SIDE NOTES

Task #23:
I'm sorry for not including my new NFA.h and NFA.cpp files 
with the commit for task 23. I got too used to only adding main.cpp,
along with the DFA files before a commit that I forgot to add the NFA files. 

Task #29:
I decided to change the definition of my TT object. It was getting difficult to code with long lines of code. 
I also created one addition NFA called N13. I got to my N5 NFA when creating the tree and realised it was infinite. 
I also wrote another NFA called N14.
